Contributor Guide
=================

Issue Tracker
-------------
Looking to contribute? That's great!

Take a look at the following labels in the issue tracker:
- [good first issue][issues.good-first-issue]: gets assigned to the issues that are assumed to be appropriate for new contributors to get themselves familiar with the code;
- [help wanted][issues.help-wanted]: this is a wider scope, gets assigned to any issues that require help from contributors.

Keep an eye on the following issue labels:
- [status:waiting-for-info][issues.waiting-for-info]: a bot automatically closes these issues if there's no activity for 2 weeks. The maintainers should remove this label after they've got the info they've requested from the users, to prevent the bot from closing the issue.

Development Prerequisites
-------------------------
JDK 17 is required to develop the plugin.

If you use the default Gradle wrapper (`gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`), it will be auto-downloaded on wrapper start. Otherwise (say, to open the project in an IDE), you should get a JDK17-compatible installation. For example, install [Amazon Corretto 17][downloads.corretto].

Build and Test
--------------
Use the following shell command:
```
$ ./gradlew build
```

Lexer and Parser
----------------
This project uses lexer generated by JFlex and parser generated by Grammar-Kit, as described in the IntelliJ documentation:
- [Implementing Lexer][docs.lexer]
- [Implementing Parser and PSI][docs.parser]

They are automatically generated from the `.flex` and `.bnf` files on build.
